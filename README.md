# portfolio-optimization-project

* Conducted a portfolio optimization project utilizing Python and financial data analysis techniques to determine the optimal allocation of assets for a hypothetical investment portfolio.
* Utilized historical stock price data for six major technology companies (Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and SPDR S&P 500 ETF) to construct the portfolio.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis and utilized Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal portfolio weights for the six stocks that would maximize the expected return while minimizing volatility.
* Implemented the optimal portfolio weights to derive key portfolio statistics, including expected return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio, to evaluate the performance of the portfolio.
